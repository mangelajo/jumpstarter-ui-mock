# Setting up a PatternFly Application using patternfly-react-seed

This guide outlines the steps to clone the [patternfly-react-seed](mdc:https:/github.com/patternfly/patternfly-react-seed) repository and use it as a starting point for building a new PatternFly application.

The `patternfly-react-seed` project provides a scaffold for web apps, giving developers a quick start with PatternFly. It includes an application layout with a header and sidebar, routing, a build pipeline, a test suite, and code quality tools.

## Prerequisites: Environment Setup

Before you begin, ensure your development environment is correctly configured:

1.  **Node.js and npm:** Both Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) must be installed and accessible in your system's PATH. 
    *   You can check their versions by running: `node --version && npm --version`
    *   If they are not found, download and install Node.js from [https://nodejs.org/](mdc:https:/nodejs.org). npm is included with Node.js.
2.  **Using nvm (Optional but Recommended):** If you use Node Version Manager (nvm):
    *   Ensure `nvm` itself is loaded in your shell. If `nvm` command is not found, you might need to add sourcing lines to your shell configuration file (e.g., `~/.zshrc`, `~/.bash_profile`, `~/.bashrc`) and then reload the configuration (e.g., `source ~/.zshrc`). Example lines for `.zshrc` or `.bashrc`:
        ```bash
        export NVM_DIR="$HOME/.nvm"
        [ -s "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh" ] && \. "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh"
        [ -s "$NVM_DIR/bash_completion" ] && \. "$NVM_DIR/bash_completion"
        ```
    *   Install a Node.js version if needed: `nvm install node` (for latest) or `nvm install <version>`.
    *   Ensure you are using a Node.js version: `nvm use node` or `nvm use <version>`.

## Quick Start

1.  **Clone the repository:** The AI assistant can run this for you.
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/patternfly/patternfly-react-seed
    ```

2.  **Navigate into the project directory:** The AI assistant will ensure its commands run in this directory. All `npm install` and `npm run` commands must be executed from within the `patternfly-react-seed` project directory.
    ```bash
    cd patternfly-react-seed
    ```

3.  **Install dependencies:** The AI assistant can run this for you after confirming Node.js/npm are available.
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

4.  **Start the development server (User Action Recommended):**
    *   **Recommended:** It is best for the **user to run the development server in a separate, dedicated terminal window or tab.**
        1.  Open a new terminal.
        2.  Navigate to the `patternfly-react-seed` project directory (e.g., `cd path/to/patternfly-react-seed`).
        3.  Run the command: `npm run start:dev`
    *   This approach allows you to see the live server output (compilation status, errors, etc.) directly, which is crucial for troubleshooting, without blocking the AI assistant's terminal access.
    *   The server typically runs on `http://localhost:9000` (this can be confirmed in `webpack.dev.js`).
    *   If the AI assistant needs to (re)start the server (e.g., after installing packages or making configuration changes), it will still propose the `npm run start:dev` command. However, the user should be aware that the AI running this command might obscure direct error visibility compared to running it in their own terminal.

This will start the development server, and you can begin building your application. Refer to the [README.md](mdc:README.md) in the cloned repository for more detailed information on development scripts, configuration, and available features.

## Indexing PatternFly Documentation and Code

To have easy access to the official PatternFly documentation and codebase within your IDE, you should index the following resources:

1.  **PatternFly Official Documentation:**
    *   Use your IDE's features to add a new documentation source.
    *   Provide the URL: `https://www.patternfly.org/`

2.  **PatternFly Core Code (HTML/CSS):**
    *   Use your IDE's features to index a Git repository.
    *   Provide the URL: `https://github.com/patternfly/patternfly`

3.  **PatternFly React Code:**
    *   Use your IDE's features to index a Git repository.
    *   Provide the URL: `https://github.com/patternfly/patternfly-react`

4.  **Additional Local Documentation:**
    *   For additional context on PatternFly Chatbot, also reference the local file: [patternfly-chatbot.txt](mdc:patternfly-chatbot.txt) (see Chatbot Implementation section below for more details).
    *   For information on PatternFly React Component Groups, reference the local file: [patternfly-react-component-groups.txt](mdc:patternfly-react-component-groups.txt)

## General PatternFly Development Guidelines

When building applications with PatternFly, keep the following in mind:

*   **Class Naming:** Always use current PatternFly class names. Valid class names start with `pf-v6-`. Avoid using older class names, such as those prefixed with `pf-v5-`.
*   **Styling:** Prefer PatternFly utility classes for custom styling needs. Avoid writing custom CSS whenever possible. PatternFly provides a rich set of utility classes for common styling adjustments (spacing, typography, flexbox, etc.). Refer to the PatternFly documentation for available utility classes.
*   **Troubleshooting Component Usage:** If component imports are failing or components are not behaving as expected, consult the official PatternFly documentation and **especially the 'View Code' or example sections of the relevant component/demo pages** on [patternfly.org](mdc:https:/www.patternfly.org). Providing these code snippets to the AI assistant can greatly expedite troubleshooting.

## PatternFly Chatbot Implementation

When implementing the PatternFly Chatbot feature:

*   **Primary Context:** The file [patternfly-chatbot.txt](mdc:patternfly-chatbot.txt) should be considered the primary source of information for understanding the chatbot's internal structure, available components (e.g., `Chatbot.tsx`, `ChatMessage.tsx`), and how they are organized.
*   **Package Reference:** Based on the context from `patternfly-chatbot.txt`, assume the relevant NPM package for the chatbot is `@patternfly/chatbot`. 
    *   Installation: `npm install @patternfly/chatbot`
*   **Import Paths & Demo Code:** 
    *   Many specific chatbot sub-components (e.g., `ChatbotContent`, `MessageBar`, `Message`) are often imported from a **dynamic path** like `'@patternfly/chatbot/dist/dynamic/...'`. 
    *   **Crucial Tip:** When implementing or troubleshooting the chatbot, refer to the official PatternFly demo pages. If possible, **provide the AI assistant with the relevant demo source code snippet** for the specific feature or layout you are trying to achieve. This is the most reliable way to ensure correct component usage, props, and import paths.
*   **CSS Styling:** 
    *   Ensure the chatbot's CSS is imported, typically: `import '@patternfly/chatbot/dist/css/main.css';`
    *   The path to this CSS directory (e.g., `node_modules/@patternfly/chatbot/dist/css`) may need to be added to `stylePaths.js` for Webpack to process it correctly.
*   **Inspiration and Structure (from Demos):**
    *   For a **default chatbot** (often in an overlay or modal), refer to the structure and components used in the [Basic Chatbot Demo](mdc:https:/www.patternfly.org/patternfly-ai/chatbot/overview/demo/basic-chatbot).
    *   For an **embedded chatbot** (integrated directly into a page section), refer to the structure and components used in the [Embedded Chatbot Demo](mdc:https:/www.patternfly.org/patternfly-ai/chatbot/overview/demo/embedded-chatbot).
    *   In general, the [Chatbot Demos Overview](mdc:https:/www.patternfly.org/patternfly-ai/chatbot/overview/demo) is a good resource for various chatbot patterns and features.
*   This guidance (especially regarding package name, primary context file, and reliance on demo code for imports) supersedes other general references if there are discrepancies.
