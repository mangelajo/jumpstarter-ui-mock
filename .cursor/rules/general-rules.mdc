# Project Rules

## Purpose
Define interaction with the user in terms of runtime actions: linting, running, etc.

## Scope
This rule applies to the end of interactions with the user after modifications have been made.
ocumentation/README.md`.

## Rule
- **Never run the service yourself, provide a copy paste action for the user to run `npm start` since the service auto-reloads content and it's only necessary to run it once.**

- **Whenever you finish making changes perform an `npm build`to identify errors.**
- **Whenever you finish making changes look at the user terminal to see if there are any errors from the running server.**
